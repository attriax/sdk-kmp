/**
 * Automatic crash reporting (Flutter reference
 * `AttriaxCrashReportingManager`, attriax_crash_reporting_manager.dart).
 *
 * Two durability strategies, both persisting the crash as the SAME crash/error wire
 * request the manual [com.attriax.sdk.AttriaxTracking.recordError] builds (reused via
 * [buildFatalCrash] / the engine crash builder — no new DTO):
 *
 * Fatal crashes are always **persist-only** — never enqueued at capture time. Whether
 * the crash arrives via the OS uncaught handler or a wrapper's `recordError(fatal =
 * true)`, the record is written to the [KeyValueStore] SYNCHRONOUSLY and delivered
 * EXCLUSIVELY on the NEXT [com.attriax.sdk.Attriax.init] via [replayPendingCrashReport],
 * which enqueues it through the durable queue and clears the record (one-shot). This
 * gives exactly-once delivery — the durable queue persists + retries across restarts,
 * so a single enqueue on replay is loss-free without ever double-sending the happy path.
 * Mirrors Flutter `_persistFatalCrashForRetry` (persist only) + `_replayPendingCrashReport`.
 *
 * Only NON-fatal `recordError(fatal = false)` enqueues immediately (no persist) — it is
 * a normal buffered request, not a process-death backup.
 *
 * The persist key + format mirror Flutter's `pendingCrashReportStorageKey`
 * ('attriax.crash.pending') — the crash request body JSON. The whole surface is
 * gated by [enabled] (`AttriaxConfig.automaticCrashReportingEnabled`, default `true`
 * matching Flutter): when off, no handler is installed and no replay happens.
 *
 * All I/O goes straight through the injected [store] — never the background executor
 * — because the synchronous persist runs while the process is terminating.
